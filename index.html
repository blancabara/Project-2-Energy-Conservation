                <h2>Why Energy Consumption is a Problem</h2>
                <p>Energy consumption is a growing problem.  Research done by Michigan Creative, a unit of the Office of the Vice President for Communications,states "Each day, U.S. per capita energy consumption includes 2.5 gallons of oil, 8.86 pounds of coal, and 246 cubic feet of natural gas. Residential daily consumption of electricity is 12 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per person.", such a large consumption of electricity is causing higher bills, higher cost in oil, and higher demands.</p>

                <h2>Greenhouse gasses</h2>
                <p>One of the major problems the world faces when it comes to energy consumption is that its production still creates a large amount of greenhouse gasses. The production of energy makes up to 87% of greenhouse gas emissions in the entire world. Along with that, CO2 emissions have been rapidly increasing and reached 36.6 billion tonnes in 2018. Energy consumption is greatly affecting the state of our environment. Not only does it affect our world now, but it will also do so in the later years. </p>

                <h2>Energy Prices</h2>
                <p>Another problem with energy consumption is the increased cost. In some countries, such as Germany, the energy prices are up to their highest level on record. Household energy bills are expected tincrease and are likely to have a bigger impact on vulnerable families. The supply is quite low, but the demand is only getting higher.</p>
