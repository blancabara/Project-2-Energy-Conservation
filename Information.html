                <h2>Contributing on an Individual Level</h2>
                <p>Electric utility energy efficiency (EE) and energy conservation (EC) programs are often focused on reducing the usage of electricity, especially during times where electricity is used the most. A viable solution could be switching to more sustainable and cheaper options. There are many tools and alternatives, such as lights, that are made to save energy and are also a great help to lowering obsessive amounts of energy usage.</p>

                <h2>Do It Yourself</h2>
                <p>Another useful resource could be by doing it yourself. A professional is always best, but from www.energy.gov, they provide ways to pinpoint easier areas to address. Walking around your home checking issues you see and even checking for air leaks, which if present, and resolved, could save up to 10 to 20 percent of energy. Many other things like checking your insulation levels, your heating and cooling system, and managing your light usage are proven to be very effective in reducing energy usage.</p>

                <h2>LED Lighting</h2>
                <p>Not all ways of conserving energy have to be repairs, some can be simple changes. Take light bulbs for example. LED light bulbs use 75% less electricity than an average lightbulb. That's a lot less energy used, especially since people use lights almost every day. Not only do they use less energy but they last longer as well, which is more environmentally friendly.</p>

                <h2>Other Installments</h2>
                <p>Some other installments that can be done to reduce energy consumption are insulation, energy-efficient windows, and smart thermostats. Adding insulation to your home can help by keeping warmth in during the cold season, and hot air out during the heat season. Energy-efficient windows are an installment similar to how insulation works and will help keep a regulated temperature. Smart thermostats can help lower energy bills by automatically having a preferred schedule of energy-saving temperatures.</p>
